A novel self-backtracking method for improving language model reasoning.

![Self-Backtracking Method](images/self-backtracking-method.jpg)

## Overview
This repository implements the Self-BackTracking method, that equips LLMs with the ability to backtrack during both training and inference. This mechanism not only enhances reasoning ability but also efficiency by transforming slow-thinking processes into fast-thinking through self-improvement.

## Dataset and Model
The project utilizes the Countdown dataset, which is pre-constructed and accessible on Hugging Face. Additionally, we have open-sourced our trained model based on Llama-3.2-1B.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup (important)
- Python: 3.10â€“3.11 recommended.
- Create and activate a virtual environment.
- Install pinned dependencies to avoid NumPy/torch/torchvision ABI issues:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
```

If you still see errors like "A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.x" or
"module 'torch.library' has no attribute 'register_fake'", ensure these pairs are installed and active:

- numpy==1.26.4
- torch==2.1.2 and torchvision==0.16.2 (matching versions)

You can enforce this with:

```
pip uninstall -y numpy torchvision
pip install --no-cache-dir numpy==1.26.4 torchvision==0.16.2
```

Optionally, if you do not use any vision models, removing torchvision completely also avoids the import path:

```
pip uninstall -y torchvision
```

Weights & Biases logging is optional. To enable `--wandb`, install it:

```
pip install wandb
```

### Dataset Notes
- The training scripts expect the Hugging Face dataset `yangxw/countdown-backtracking` with columns: `nums`, `target`, and `search_path`.
- If the upstream dataset script is temporarily inconsistent, the code falls back to downloading raw files from the Hub and constructing the dataset locally.
- If `search_path` is missing, training cannot proceed. Please retry after the upstream dataset is fixed or supply local files that include these columns.

### Training
To train the model:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py \
    --config ../configs/sft.conf
```
You can change the parameters in the `configs/sft.conf` file.

If you want to use multiple GPUs:
```bash
accelerate launch \
    --config_file ../configs/accelerate.yaml \
    train.py \
    --config ../configs/sft.conf
```

### Inference
To inference the model using our self-backtracking method, you can run the following command:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python eval_search.py \
    --num 5000 \
    --ckpt [your_model_ckpt] \
    --data [val/val_new] \
    --decoder self_backtrack \
    --b 1 \
    --n 32
```
--ckpt defaults to `yangxw/Llama-3.2-1B-countdown-backtrack`. You can use our trained model available on Hugging Face.

### Self-Improvement
To further improve the model, you can run the following command:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_self_improvement.py \
    --num 5000 \
    --past_model [your_model_ckpt] \
    --data [val/val_new]
```
